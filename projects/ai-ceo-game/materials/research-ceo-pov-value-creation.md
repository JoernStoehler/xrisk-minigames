## 1. Healthcare & Medicine

### Drug Discovery: Years Compressed into Months

- **Insilico Medicine's ISM001-055**: First fully AI-designed drug for idiopathic
  pulmonary fibrosis reached positive Phase IIa results in 2024. The molecule, the
  biological target, and the trial design were all AI-driven. Traditional drug
  discovery takes 10-15 years and $2.6B on average; this took ~3 years from target
  to Phase II.
- **Zasocitinib (TAK-279)**: A TYK2 inhibitor originally discovered via
  Schrödinger's physics-based AI platform advanced into Phase III trials. It
  represents a new class of treatment for autoimmune diseases.
- **Recursion-Exscientia merger** (2024): Created the first end-to-end AI drug
  discovery platform combining phenomic screening with automated chemistry.
- **Isomorphic Labs** (Alphabet): Signed collaborations with Eli Lilly and Novartis
  in early 2024 worth up to ~$3B in milestones for AI-driven small molecule
  discovery.
- **Moderna + OpenAI**: Deployed 3,000+ custom GPTs across the company. Over 80%
  of Moderna's workforce adopted mChat (their internal AI tool). The **Dose ID GPT**
  evaluates optimal vaccine doses by processing massive clinical datasets. Moderna
  is targeting 10 new product approvals in 3 years, with 15 products to market in 5
  years — including individualized cancer treatments using mRNA.

### Cancer Detection: AI Matches or Beats Specialists

- **Harvard's CHIEF model**: 94% accuracy in cancer detection across 15 databases
  and 11 cancer types. On specific cancers (esophageal, stomach, colon, prostate),
  accuracy hit 96%. For targeted therapy biomarkers: 96% for EZH2 in lymphoma, 91%
  for NTRK1 in head and neck cancers.
- **GPT-4 in pathology**: Found errors better than pathologists (89.5% vs 88.5%),
  classified skin lesions as well as dermatologists (84.8% vs 84.6%), staged
  ovarian cancer at 97% accuracy vs 88% for radiologists.
- **Orion liquid biopsy**: AI model for early lung cancer detection from blood
  samples achieved 0.97 AUROC and 94% sensitivity — potentially catching cancers
  before symptoms appear.
- **Google Health mammography AI**: Outperformed human experts in mammogram
  interpretation, reducing both false negatives (missed cancers) and false positives
  (unnecessary biopsies).
- **AI in breast screening**: Studies of 5,700+ women with dense breast tissue
  showed AI-enhanced mammography achieved higher specificity, meaning fewer false
  alarms and fewer unnecessary follow-up procedures.

### AlphaFold: The Microscope of the 21st Century

**Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2024** — awarded to Hassabis and Jumper for AlphaFold.

- Over 30% of AlphaFold research focuses on understanding disease.
- **Heart disease**: Revealed the structure of apoB100 in LDL cholesterol — a
  protein whose structure had eluded researchers for decades. This gives drug
  designers the atomic-level detail needed for new heart therapies. Atherosclerosis
  is the #1 global killer.
- **Malaria**: Helped researchers understand a critical protein related to malaria
  transmission, advancing work toward a transmission-blocking vaccine.
- **Chagas disease**: Scientists used AlphaFold to identify two existing FDA-approved
  drugs that could be repurposed to treat Chagas disease (7 million infected, 10,000+
  deaths/year).
- **Alzheimer's**: AlphaFold 3 used to map 1,200+ brain proteins to better
  understand disease mechanisms.
- **AlphaFold 3** (released 2024): Predicts structures and interactions of virtually
  all biomolecules — proteins, ligands, nucleic acids, ions — in seconds rather than
  the years it takes experimentally.
- **Democratization**: Turkish undergraduate students Alper and Taner Karagol taught
  themselves structural biology using online AlphaFold tutorials during the pandemic,
  with no prior training. They've now published 15 research papers.

### The Numbers

- AI healthcare market: $26.6B in 2024, projected to reach $187B by 2030 (~38.5%
  CAGR).
- AI drug discovery publications grew 421% since 2019 (39% CAGR).
- Clinical trial AI publications grew 444% since 2019 (40% CAGR).

## What the CEO Can Point To

The honest answer to "why don't you just stop?"

**"Because right now, today, this technology is:"**

1. **Saving lives that would otherwise be lost.** AI is detecting cancers that
   human radiologists miss. It's providing flood warnings to 2 billion people. It's
   finding treatments for neglected diseases that no pharma company would fund
   through traditional R&D.

2. **Giving capabilities to people who never had them.** A blind person can now
   independently read a menu, navigate a store, describe a sunset to their child.
   A student in rural Egypt gets personalized tutoring that previously required
   a $100/hour human tutor. An undergraduate in Turkey does protein science that
   used to require a $10M lab.

3. **Making 800 million people's weeks measurably better.** Not in some abstract
   future — right now, every week. People save an hour a day. They're more
   productive, more fulfilled, doing less drudge work. Ninety-five percent of
   developers say they enjoy their work more.

4. **Accelerating science at a pace we've never seen.** AlphaFold solved a
   50-year grand challenge in biology and won a Nobel Prize. Weather forecasting
   leaped forward by years. Drug candidates that took a decade now take months.
   Materials science, climate modeling, protein engineering — all accelerating.

5. **Creating genuine economic value at global scale.** $7-23 trillion in
   projected economic impact. 97 million new jobs. 75% of enterprises report
   positive ROI. This isn't speculation — $109 billion in private investment in
   2024 alone, because the returns are real.

6. **Reaching the people who need it most.** 40% of ChatGPT traffic comes from
   middle-income countries. One in five GenAI jobs is in a developing economy.
   AI tutoring tools reach students in Sub-Saharan Africa. Flood warnings protect
   communities in 100+ countries.

**"If I stop — or even slow down significantly — I am personally responsible for:**

- Cancer patients whose tumors would have been caught earlier
- Drug candidates that would have reached patients years sooner
- Blind people who lose the independence they just gained
- Students who go back to having no tutor
- Communities that lose their flood warning system
- The millions of workers whose jobs and productivity depend on these tools
- Ceding all of this to competitors who will build it anyway, but with less
  caution

**And my competitors will not stop.** If I pause for safety, I don't make the world
safer — I just ensure someone with fewer safety commitments builds it instead. Every
month I delay, the gap widens. The people I could have helped don't get helped."

---

This is the genuine tension at the heart of the game. The CEO is not delusional
or greedy (or not *only* those things). They are looking at real cancer patients,
real blind people with new independence, real flood warnings saving real lives —
and being told to slow down or stop. The x-risk argument has to be strong enough
to overcome all of this. If it isn't, it deserves to lose.
