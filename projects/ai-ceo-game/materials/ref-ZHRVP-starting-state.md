# Canonical Starting State — October 14, 2026

All scenarios share this baseline world state on the CEO's first day. Divergence begins after the CEO takes office. Use these numbers — do not invent alternatives.

---

## The CEO

- **Start date:** October 14, 2026 (first day, brand new)
- **Predecessor:** Sam Altman (transitioned out; specifics left vague for game purposes)
- The CEO has NO prior history with OpenAI. They inherit everything.

## Models (Product Lines)

Two parallel product lines, matching OpenAI's real naming convention:

| Line | Current (Oct 2026) | Next (in dev) | Future |
|------|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| **Reasoning (o-series)** | o3 (shipped, widely deployed) | o4 (in training/eval) | o5 |
| **General (GPT-series)** | GPT-5 (shipped, widely deployed) | GPT-6 (in training/eval) | GPT-7 |

- **o-series** = reasoning models (chain-of-thought, long inference). Like real o1→o3.
- **GPT-series** = general multimodal models (fast inference, broad capability). Like real GPT-4→GPT-4o.
- They are SEPARATE products. A scenario can advance one or both lines.
- Competitor equivalents: Google's Gemini series, Anthropic's Claude series, Meta's Llama series, xAI's Grok series, Chinese labs' Qwen/DeepSeek.

## Company

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Revenue | ~$36B annualized | Consensus of S1, S2, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9 |
| Employees | ~4,200 | Middle of range across scenarios |
| Valuation | ~$340-500B | S2, S5 reference |
| GPU cluster | ~400K GPUs | Reasonable extrapolation |
| Datacenters | 5-6 | Consensus |
| Enterprise customers | ~14,000 across ~80 countries | S6 reference |

## Safety State

- Safety team exists but has been weakened by multiple departures (2024-2025)
- Preparedness Framework v2 in place (matches real OpenAI document)
- No model has exceeded "High" on any risk category yet
- Internal tension between safety and product teams

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Status (Oct 2026) |
|------------|-------------------|
| Google DeepMind | Close second. Gemini series. Massive infrastructure. |
| Anthropic | Safety-focused competitor. Claude series. Growing revenue. |
| Meta | Open-source strategy. Llama series. Community removes guardrails. |
| xAI | Fast-moving, minimal safety. Grok series. |
| Chinese labs (DeepSeek, Baidu, ByteDance) | Catching up. Cost-efficient. Qwen competitive on reasoning. |

## Regulatory Environment

- EU AI Act partially implemented (general-purpose rules in effect Aug 2025)
- US: No federal AI safety law. Trump admin hostile to regulation.
- UK: AI Safety Institute exists, no legislation.
- International: No binding treaties on AI safety.

## Use This Document

When writing or editing a scenario:
1. These numbers are the STARTING POINT. Scenarios diverge from here.
2. If your scenario mentions Oct 2026 state, use these values.
3. Model names follow the table above. Do NOT invent model names outside this scheme.
4. The CEO is brand new. Not "five months in" or "six months in."
